## 🧪 1. Data Preprocessing and Baseline Model – Fake News Detection in Media

### 📁 File: `01_Data_Preprocessing_and_Baseline_Model.ipynb`

### 📌 Overview:
This notebook tackles the problem of detecting **fake news in the media industry**, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to process raw news headlines, clean and vectorize the text, and evaluate baseline machine learning models for classification.

### 🔧 Workflow:
- **Dataset Loading**: Prepares and explores the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Text normalization including stopwords removal, lemmatization, etc.
- **Vectorization**: Uses `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.
- **Modeling**: Trains baseline models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics are used for comparison.

### 📈 Output:
Presents confusion matrices and detailed classification reports to help evaluate model performance.
